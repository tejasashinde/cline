# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively patch only the most recent minor release of Cline. Older versions receive fixes at our discretion.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/cline/cline/security/advisories/new) tab.

The team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

When reporting, please include:

- A short summary of the issue
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- Any logs, stack traces, or screenshots that might help us understand the problem

We acknowledge reports within 48 hours and aim to release a fix or mitigation within 30 days. While we work on a resolution, please keep the details private.
